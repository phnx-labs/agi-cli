   * while a connection is open, browser clients hold one open on purpose, and
   * the timeout was set equal to the daemon's own SIGTERM grace window
   * (`STOP_GRACE_MS`) — so `handleShutdown` was still inside `stop()` when
   * `stopDaemon` gave up waiting and killed it. So we END the connections
   * rather than wait for them: `close()` stops accepting, destroying the
   * tracked sockets lets it complete, and the timeout is only a backstop for a
   * socket that will not die, deliberately far below `STOP_GRACE_MS`.
