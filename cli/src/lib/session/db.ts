  // Candidates come from the FTS5 `label` column, not a raw `LOWER(label) LIKE

  // scanning every row, at the cost of only matching at token boundaries — a
  // substring inside a single token (e.g. "ckf" inside "quickfix") no longer
  // matches, since FTS5 only indexes prefixes of whole tokens, not arbitrary
  // interior slices. (A slice spanning a token boundary, like "ix-b" inside
  // "fix-bug", still matches: "ix-b" tokenizes to "ix" + "b", and "b" is a
  // valid prefix of the "bug" token.) That's the accepted trade-off for an
  // indexable interactive path; the exact/prefix/contains scoring below still
  // runs in JS over the FTS candidate set, so ranking among real matches is
